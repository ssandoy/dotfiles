# Simple Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose

Provide lightweight documentation for significant changes to help your future self understand why certain choices were made.

## README Files

Add README.md files in key directories with brief explanations:

```
config/zsh/README.md
config/nvim/README.md
```

Example content:
```markdown
# Zsh Configuration

## Structure
- `plugins.zsh`: Plugin management
- `aliases.zsh`: Command aliases
- `functions.zsh`: Custom functions

## Key Decisions
- Using zinit for plugin management (faster than oh-my-zsh)
- Split configuration into topic-based files for maintainability
- Added platform detection for cross-platform support
```

## Code Comments

Add context when making significant configuration choices:

```bash
# Using this approach instead of alternative because:
# 1. Better performance (tested 2025-04)
# 2. Works across macOS and Linux
# 3. Easier to maintain
```

## Changelog

For significant changes, add a brief note in a changelog file:

```markdown
# Changelog

## 2025-04-28
- Switched from oh-my-zsh to zinit for better startup time
- Benchmark: Reduced shell startup from 0.8s to 0.4s

## 2025-04-20
- Migrated vim config to XDG structure
- Added WSL compatibility for git credentials
```

## Benchmark Notes

For performance-related changes, include simple benchmark results:

```bash
# Before: 0.45s startup
# After: 0.32s startup
# Tested: macOS 14.4, 2025-04-28
```

This lightweight approach provides context for your decisions without the formality of full architecture decision records, which are better suited for team projects.
