# Web Research Integration

## Purpose

This rule provides guidelines for using web search and content fetching to ensure your dotfiles follow current best practices.

## Research Process

1. **Search for Current Best Practices**
   ```
   web_search "latest <tool> configuration best practices"
   web_search "<tool> dotfiles XDG compliance"
   web_search "<tool> macOS vs Linux configuration differences"
   ```

2. **Fetch Specific Resources**
   ```
   mcp_fetch_fetch {url: "https://relevant-documentation.com/page"}
   ```

3. **Analyze Findings**
   - Compare multiple sources
   - Consider recency of information
   - Evaluate compatibility with our multi-platform approach

## When to Use Web Research

- Before implementing new tool configurations
- When troubleshooting compatibility issues between platforms
- To understand new features of tools in our stack
- Before making structural changes to dotfiles

## Example Workflow

For updating Zsh configuration:

```
# Search for best practices
web_search "zsh configuration best practices 2025"

# Check XDG compliance guidelines 
web_search "zsh XDG Base Directory support"

# Fetch specific documentation
mcp_fetch_fetch {url: "https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit#xdg-base-directory-support"}

# Apply findings to our modular structure
