# GNU Stow Guidelines

## Overview

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager that creates symlinks from a central repository to their appropriate locations in the filesystem. It enables:

- Centralized management of dotfiles in version control
- Selective enabling/disabling of specific applications
- Seamless syncing between machines

## Installation

```bash
# macOS
brew install stow

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install stow

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install stow
```

## Repository Structure

Our dotfiles follow this application-based structure:

```
.dotfiles/
├── .stowrc              # Stow configuration
└── config/              # All configuration files
    ├── zsh/             # Zsh configuration (stow zsh)
    ├── git/             # Git configuration (stow git)
```

Each application directory mirrors the structure needed in your home directory:

```
config/zsh/
├── .config/         # Goes to ~/.config/
│   └── zsh/         # Goes to ~/.config/zsh/
└── .zshrc           # Goes to ~/.zshrc
```

## Basic Commands

With our `.stowrc` file in place:

```bash
# Stow all configurations
./stow-all.sh

# Stow specific applications
stow zsh git tmux

# Re-stow (update) applications
stow -R zsh

# Delete symlinks for an application
stow -D zsh
```

## Best Practices

### XDG Compliance

Place configuration files in `.config/` directories:

```
config/git/.config/git/config  # Becomes ~/.config/git/config
```
